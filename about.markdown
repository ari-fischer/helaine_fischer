I earned my PhD in Chemical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley (2021). My doctoral studies focused on the fundamental mechanisms behind metal-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions and the synergies between metals and metal oxides. 

I am currently a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. I apply multiscale modelling, computational chemistry tools, and mechanistic inquiry to explore the nature of oxidation reactions driven by ultrasound. 

I hope to use this page as a professional page and an educational blog. Stay tuned!
